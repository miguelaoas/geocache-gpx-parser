**NOTE: THIS PROJECT IS NOW HOSTED [HERE, AT BITBUCKET](https://bitbucket.org/ZeroOne3010/geogpxparser/).** The project does _not_ get updated at Google Code anymore.

This program is great especially for analyzing your My Finds Pocket Query files. Technically this program is used to parse a .gpx file, which is an XML file, of geocaches into plain old Java objects (POJO). The caches are then saved as a tab delimited text file, one cache per row. In this format it is easy to load the caches into a spreadsheet program for further inspection.

In addition to saving the caches as a text file, another text file is also saved: one with statistics about the owners of the caches. This file contains details on how many caches have each of them hidden and what type of caches are they.

Download the GeoGPXParser.zip file if you just want to use the program and do not care about the source code. :) The usage happens from the command line and the simple instructions for that are on the download page as well as inside the download package.
